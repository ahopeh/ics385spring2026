            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">I'm April, a technology student at UH Maui College pursuing my degree in Applied Business and Information Technology. My work currently centers on cybersecurity, data analytics, and web accessibility. Through research positions with NSF and NIWC I've gained hands-on experience in data analytics, WCAG compliance, and cybersecurity research for defense applications. The challenge of building technology that's not only functional and secure but also genuinely usable for everyone motivates me as I continue on my academic path.</p>
